<h3>Howdy 👋,</h3> I'm a full stack engineer, cyber security professional and CTF player. I love to build
secure and beautiful applications, but I also love to break into them and find their weak spots. It's
like solving a puzzle with a prize at the end. This is all done for fun and learning in a controlled
lab I own.

I created this blog to share the knowledge I gained from my research and prototyping of various technologies and pentest/redteam techniques.
You'll find some cool tricks and tips on how to hack like a pro.
And by pro, I mean someone who can open a shell on a machine without AV enabled and not someone who can hack the Pentagon. We operate with training wheels in this blog, if you wish to remove them and go full speed down that hill with a 30° grade . . . . well to each their own I suppose 🤷‍♂️. My advice, just don't.

> User experience should never be compromised by security measures, and likewise, security should never be a detriment to the user experience.
